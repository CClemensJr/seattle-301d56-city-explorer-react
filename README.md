# city explorer
> create the city-explorer front end, with react.js!

## Overview
```Re-implement the City Explorer front end through the use of ReactJS. 
Your goal for today is to get a static/placeholder representation of 
your application configured and setup so that we can progressively modularize 
and build against that throughout the week. Essentially, you'll be setting up 
and building the scaffold today so that we can wire things together and 
integrate 3rd party APIs later on.```
