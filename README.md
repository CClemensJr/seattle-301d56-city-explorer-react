# city explorer
> create the city-explorer front end, with react.js!

## Overview
```Re-implement the City Explorer front end through the use of ReactJS. 
Today, you will be re-packaging the components you created previously 
into their own files and importing/exporting those files accordingly. 
You'll need to refactor your <Search> component to now be called <SearchForm>, 
which should be configured to pass location information to the <Map> component 
and have it render as such. Along with refactoring your <Search> component, 
it's time to add a parent component for our individual search results. 
That should be called <SearchResults> and should render out each result indivdually.```
